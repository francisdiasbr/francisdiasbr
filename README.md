<h3><mark>🎬 The Movie Search</mark></h3>

It is a **system** to interact with Internet Movie Database (bulk catalogue, in localhost), create a curatory of movies, generate blogposts (all of that in Admin project locally), and after that publish the blogposts in a Blog. 
The project also has and two APIs, one for each frontend application.
