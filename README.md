üëê This is my personal profile. Here I share projects based on my actual needs and hobbies.


About me:

My name is Francis and I'm a brazilian software developer with +5 years collaborating in projects in PT & EN;

Before that I worked as a chemical engineer for 10 years.


## Repositories I'm working on (all public, except Turin app):

I‚Äôm currently practicing the latest trendings in AI: Atlas Vector Search and trained models. In these matters, you can check these repositories that are using generative AI or Vector Search:

<summary>SEARCH BY NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERY: üè° Intelligent Real Estate Search Platform</summary>

<br/>
Is a real-state app that uses AI to perform search in a Atlas Vector Search database using natural language queries (voice and text).

<br/>
1. Backend (Python)
[https://github.com/francisdiasbr/py-mineral-book](https://github.com/francisdiasbr/real-estate-app-api)
2. Frontend (React Native + Expo Managed App)
[https://github.com/francisdiasbr/mineral-book](https://github.com/francisdiasbr/real-estate-app)


Replace complex forms with a smart search bar that understands queries like "sunny 3-bedroom apartment near subway" or "pet-friendly house with backyard under 800k".

<summary>MOVIES: üé¨ The Movie Search</summary>
<br/>

<br/>
 (a complete cockpit to organize and publish to the world your passion for cinema - favorite, learn from IMDb about the movie, watch the movie, listen to movie soundtrack on Spotify)
It is a **ecosystem** that interact with Internet Movie Database (through bulk catalogue, in user machine), create a curatory of movies, generate blogposts (all of that in Admin project locally), and after that publish the blogposts in a online Blog. 
The project also has and two APIs, one for each frontend application.

- In admin, user can search in IMDb catalogue, create a list of favorite movies and generate blogposts.
- In blog, users can see the generated blogposts.

2. Movie Search Admin Backend:
https://github.com/francisdiasbr/movie-search-backend (Python project with Flask). Is the backend for Movie Search. The project comprehends all the endpoints the admin application needs.
3. Movie Search Blog: https://github.com/francisdiasbr/movie-search-blog (Vite project with Redux for state management)

SEARCH REGISTERS USING SEARCH PERFORMED IN A ATLAS VECTOR DATABASE

(a project to perform search and see properties of minerals through similarity, with atlas vector search database) 
 
A complete solution for extracting, processing, storing, and searching for information about minerals in a semantic way. It illustrates the application of NLP techniques and semantic search on real datasets, providing a foundation for recommendation systems, enhanced search, and text analysis.
