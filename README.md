## Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile 👋


✨ My name is Francis and I'm a brazilian software developer with 3+ years collaborating in projects.

  🏔️ I am currently working on developing a tourism application, focused on the organic creation of itineraries by users;
  
  🌱 I’m currently learning the latest trendings in AI, such as Atlas Vector Search and trained models;
  
  👯 I’m aiming to collaborate on projects related to tourism platforms where I can contribute my experience in building and managing tourism applications like the Turin App;
  
  💬 Ask me about my experience as the lead developer of the Turin App, a tourism application where I managed communication with clients, collaborated with UX/UI designers, and published the app on the iOS store.
