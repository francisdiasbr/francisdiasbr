## Hey, it's Fran! Welcome to my GitHub profile üëã

üëê This is my personal profile. My professional profile is not open to the public.

My name is Francis and I'm a brazilian software developer with 6 years collaborating in projects in PT & EN.

Before that I worked as a chemical engineer for 10 years.

  
I‚Äôm currently practicing the latest trendings in AI, such as Atlas Vector Search and trained models. 
In these matters, you can check these repositories that are using generative AI or Vector Search:

### üé¨ The Movie Search

w/ Langchain

It is a **system** to interact with Internet Movie Database (bulk catalogue, in localhost), create a curatory of movies, generate blogposts (all of that in Admin project locally), and after that publish the blogposts in a Blog. 
The project also has and two APIs, one for each frontend application.

- In admin, user can search in IMDb catalogue, create a list of favorite movies and generate blogposts.
- In blog, users can see the generated blogposts.


#### 1. Movie Search Admin Frontend:
https://github.com/francisdiasbr/movie-search-frontend (Next project with Redux for state management)

#### 2. Movie Search Admin Backend:
https://github.com/francisdiasbr/movie-search-backend (Python project with Flask)
Is the backend for Movie Search. The project comprehends all the endpoints the admin application needs.

#### 3. Movie Search Blog:

### üîÆ Mineral-book

w/ Vector Search

A complete solution for extracting, processing, storing, and searching for information about minerals in a semantic way. It illustrates the application of NLP techniques and semantic search on real datasets, providing a foundation for recommendation systems, enhanced search, and text analysis.

See the projects to learn more about each repository of the application.

#### 1. Backend (Python)
