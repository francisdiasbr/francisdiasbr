<h3><mark>🎬 The Movie Search</mark></h3>

w/ Langchain

It is a **system** to interact with Internet Movie Database (bulk catalogue, in localhost), create a curatory of movies, generate blogposts (all of that in Admin project locally), and after that publish the blogposts in a Blog. 
The project also has and two APIs, one for each frontend application.

- In admin, user can search in IMDb catalogue, create a list of favorite movies and generate blogposts.
- In blog, users can see the generated blogposts.
